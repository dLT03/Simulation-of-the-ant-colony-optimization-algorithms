# Simulation of the ant colony optimization algorithms

## Overview
Simulating the movement of ants in an anthill based on the ant colony optimalization algorithms in Rust. The project involved implementing the ants' intelligence, which consisted of finding food, a mechanism for leaving and sensing pheromones, and digging tunnels.

## Features
- movement of ants
- finding food
- mechanism for leaving and sensing pheromones
- digging tunnels
- ability to easily change ant and food preferences
- adding food sources with the computer mouse

## Technologies Used
- Rust
- GGEZ
